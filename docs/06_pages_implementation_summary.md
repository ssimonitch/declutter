## Key Features Implemented

### Mobile-First Design

- Large touch targets for elderly users
- Responsive layouts with mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints
- Mercari-inspired clean UI
- Japanese text hierarchy

### User Flow

1. **Dashboard** → View items, export data, navigate to capture
2. **Capture** → Select municipality, take photo, AI analysis
3. **Edit** → Review AI results, modify details, save/delete
4. **Export** → Download CSV with proper Japanese formatting

### Japanese Market Compliance

- ✅ Proper JPY formatting with ¥ symbol
- ✅ Japanese date formatting
- ✅ Municipality-specific disposal information
- ✅ Elderly-friendly large text and clear CTAs
- ✅ Respectful tone and clear instructions

### Data Management

- IndexedDB via Dexie for local storage
- Session storage for temporary data
- LocalStorage for preferences
- Blob URL lifecycle management
- CSV export with safety measures

## Technical Quality

### TypeScript

- ✅ Proper type definitions throughout
- ✅ Type-safe API interactions
- ✅ No type errors in final build

### Performance

- Debounced search in ItemsTable
- Lazy loading considerations
- Blob URL cleanup
- Proper useCallback/useMemo usage

### Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance

### Security

- CSV injection protection
- XSS prevention in user inputs
- No exposed sensitive data
- Proper input sanitization

## Quality Validation

### Build Status

```bash
npm run typecheck  # ✅ Passes
npm run lint       # ✅ Minor warnings only (unused params)
npm run build      # ✅ Builds successfully
```

### Known Issues

1. **Layout as Client Component**: Currently marked as "use client" for navigation state. Should be refactored to separate client navigation component.
2. **Lint Warnings**: 3 warnings for unused callback parameters (acceptable for required signatures)
3. **Session Storage Validation**: Could benefit from Zod schema validation

## File Structure Created

```

├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx           # Root layout with navigation
│   ├── page.tsx             # Home page (redirects)

## Agent Orchestration Summary

### Agents Used

1. **react-mobile-ui-builder**: Created all pages and navigation
2. **state-data-operations**: Implemented CSV export and municipality features
3. **japan-market-compliance**: Reviewed and improved Japanese localization
4. **fullstack-code-reviewer**: Final production readiness review

### Orchestration Pattern

Sequential implementation with parallel reviews:

1. UI implementation → Data features → Compliance review → Code review
2. Each agent focused on their specialty
3. Iterative fixes based on review feedback

## Next Steps (Post-MVP)

### High Priority

1. Refactor layout to server component with client navigation
2. Add Zod validation for session storage
3. Implement error boundaries
4. Add more municipalities

### Medium Priority

1. Add print functionality
2. Implement voice input for elderly users
3. Add tutorial/onboarding
4. Bundle size optimization

### Low Priority

1. Add regional dialect support
2. Seasonal disposal guidance
3. Community features

## Conclusion

The Pages implementation is complete and functional, providing a cohesive user experience for elderly Japanese users to manage their decluttering process. All core features work as expected, with proper Japanese localization and mobile-first design. The app follows Mercari-inspired UI patterns while maintaining simplicity for the target demographic.

The implementation successfully integrates all previously created components (DashboardSummary, ItemsTable, PhotoCapture, ItemForm) into a working application with proper navigation, data flow, and user feedback mechanisms.
